## Summary
The goal of this Odin Project assignment was to use CSS grid in order to design a mock admin dashboard that is responsive at various window breakpoints.

CSS grid, Flex, and Media queries were the main concepts used for this project. Since it is a mock design, the navigation links and buttons are not functional. The focus was more so on responsiveness than anything else.

## Resources
These UI templates served as inspiration for the design.
